# Contributing to Cortex

Thanks for helping. This file covers how the repository is laid out, how to run and test it, and a few
habits the project keeps on purpose.

## Setup

Node.js 22.16 or newer (earlier 22.x builds of `node:sqlite` have no FTS5). Nothing else.

```bash
npm install
npm test               # node:test through tsx, every file in test/
npm run typecheck      # server and board
npm run lint           # oxlint with type information; warnings fail too
npm run format:check   # prettier
npm run build          # server to dist/, board to dist/web
npm run smoke          # pack, install into an empty folder, init, start, check the API and the board
```

`npm run dev -- <command>` runs the CLI from source (`npm run dev -- start`, `npm run dev -- report`).
`npm run dev:web` serves the board with hot reload on :5173, proxied to the API on :4747.

## Tests

- One file per area in `test/`, plain `node:test` and `assert`. Helpers in `test/helpers.ts`:
  `tempProject()` for a project in a temp folder, `gitProject()` for one inside a real git repository with
  a small codebase and real commits (staleness is always tested against git, never mocked).
- Count things instead of timing them: CI machines are shared, and a count of git calls or folder listings
  does not flake (see `test/perf.test.ts`).
- The CLI is tested as a child process from source (`test/cli.test.ts`), because CI runs the tests before it
  builds.
- The web board has no component tests on purpose (they need jsdom and a second runner for a surface that
  changes quickly). Its logic lives in plain modules, and accessibility is guarded by lint rules.
- When you fix a bug, write the test first and see it fail. The commit message should say what the test
  guards and, where you measured something, the number before and after.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs typecheck, tests, build and the install smoke test on Ubuntu, Windows and
macOS, each on Node 22.16 (the oldest supported) and 24: six legs. Lint and format run once, on the
Ubuntu / Node 24 leg, because they give the same answer everywhere.

Windows matters: paths, line endings (`.cortex/.gitattributes` pins LF) and process spawning behave
differently there, and several real bugs only showed up on it.

## Habits this project keeps

- **The rules files belong to people.** `.cortex/rules/` is edited by humans only; Cortex enforces the
  rules and explains violations, and AIs cannot change them. Do not add code paths that let an AI write
  there.
- **Knowledge in Turkish, code in English.** This repository runs on its own Cortex, and its knowledge
  (the tree, items, activity) is written in Turkish, as its global rule says. Code, identifiers, commit
  messages and these repository documents are in English.
- **Knowledge lives in Cortex, not in Markdown.** Do not add design notes as `.md` files; update the
  relevant node in `.cortex/tree/` (or through the MCP tools), and log what you changed and why with
  `cortex_log_activity`.
- **Cortex never calls an LLM.** Reports, search and staleness are counted and computed, so they cost
  nothing and give the same answer every time.
- **Say why.** Comments explain why something is the way it is, not what the next line does; commit
  messages lead with the reason.

## Dependencies

`react`, `react-dom`, `marked`, `dompurify` and the fonts are `devDependencies`, and that is correct, not an
oversight: Vite bundles them into `dist/web` at build time, and the published package contains only
`dist`. `npm run smoke` proves it by installing the packed tarball into an empty folder and opening the
board. Moving them to `dependencies` would only make every user download them for nothing.

## Releasing

Maintainers: update `CHANGELOG.md`, bump the version in `package.json`, commit, then tag `vX.Y.Z` and push
the tag. `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs the full CI matrix, publishes to npm with provenance and
creates the GitHub release with that version's CHANGELOG section as its notes.
